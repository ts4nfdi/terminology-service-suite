Set *fieldList=iri,label,short_form,obo_id,ontology_name,ontology_prefix, description,type,synonym* to get full details for each autocomplete term. |\n| **obsoletes** | Set to `true` to include obsolete terms in the results. |\n| **local**     | Set to `true` to only return terms that are in a defining ontology, e.g., only return matches to gene ontology terms in the gene ontology, and exclude ontologies where those terms are also referenced. |\n| **childrenOf** | Restrict a search to all children of a given term. Supply a list of IRI for the terms that you want to search under (subclassOf/is-a relation only). Example: `childrenOf` the Snomed CT term *Myocardial infarction (disorder)* (→ heart attack) results in returning direct subclasses such as *ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)* or sub-subclasses such as *STEMI of anterior wall*. The search term *Coronary artery occlusion* will return, among other things, *Acute myocardial infarction due to left coronary artery occlusion* because it\'s a child of *Acute myocardial infarction*, which is a child of *Myocardial infarction*. |\n| **allChildrenOf** | Similar to `childrenOf`, but includes hierarchical/transitive properties like *"part of"* or *"develops from"*. Example: `allChildrenOf` the Snomed CT term *Myocardial infarction (disorder)* (→ heart attack) results in returning direct subclasses, sub-subclasses, and all other descendant terms. The search term *Coronary artery occlusion* will return, among other things, *Coronary occlusion* because it is a causative agent of *Myocardial infarction*. |\n| **rows**      | Set results per page. |\n| **start**     | Set the results page number. |\n| **lang**      | Set the language for the response, e.g., **`en`**, **`de`**, **`fr`**. The default value is **`en`**. |\n| **collection** | Restrict a search to a terminology subset, e.g., `collection=nfdi4health`. |\n| **database**  | Restrict a search via the API Gateway to specific terminology software stacks. Choose from **`ols`**, **`ontoportal`**, or **`skosmos`**. |\n    '}},Hs={parameter:{required:!1,table:{type:{summary:"string"}},defaultValue:{summary:"-"},description:`
